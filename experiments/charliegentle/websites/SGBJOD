		<h1>Smith Harrison</h1>
		<p>"I hired Charlie to do a complete redesign of my brand's website after being impressed with his site and portfolio. He instinctively knew how to take ideas, goals and visions and distill them into brilliant designs, clearly explaining options along the way. He also did an expert job in the detailed development of the site. I'm extremely pleased with the results and confident that the project couldn't have been in more capable hands."</p>
