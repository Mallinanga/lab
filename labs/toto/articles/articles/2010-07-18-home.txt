bottles with slaty water in the freezer

i'm starting my own, but doing it a little different. i'm slowly standardizing on all 12v in power supplies and chargers. then i'm going to buy a 12v sla battery (the kind you find in ups's) and a small charge controller and a solar panel to put on the roof and charge things from there. i have my cell phone charger, aa/aaa nimh chargers, linux server, and linksys router all running from one 12v power supply now, just need to swap that for a battery. i'm going to use a charge controller which has a low battery load disconnect control, but instead of letting it disconnect the load from the battery it will turn on the 120v to 12v power supply to supplement the solar if it can't keep up with the demand

if you have trouble getting a coal, or wood fire to burn throw a handful of sugar onto it. the sugar will ignite and help get the fire going.if you have trouble getting a coal, or wood fire to burn throw a handful of sugar onto it. the sugar will ignite and help get the fire going.

if you have a desktop pc that is on regularly, just tap into that power supply for handy voltages that you might need for charging various cool things...
