So you want to have a background image on your website, which always fills the screen and maintains its aspect ratio? And it has to be centered, instead of focussing at the top left corner of the image?

It is possible with jQuery and the fullscreenr plugin on this page! You can find a demonstration here [http://nanotux.com/plugins/fullscreenr/index.html] and as you can see it works perfectly in all javascript enabled browsers. Note that Internet Explorer needs some extra code to enable the transparent png used for the raster over the background image. If you want to add this code I would like to refer you to http://labs.unitinteractive.com/unitpngfix.php, but of course you could just not support IE6.

The code is quite self explanatory, and I've included comments where necessary.
